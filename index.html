        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            Despite increasing interest in machine unlearning, recent work shows that under strong evaluations,
            existing techniques largely fail to unlearn in non-convex settings. In this paper, we introduce a new
            technique for machine unlearning in such settings. Key to our method is a reduction from the problem of
            machine unlearning to that of data attribution. In particular, we show theoretically (in an underdetermined
            regression setting) and empirically (in a standard deep learning setting) that given access to the outputs of a
            perfectly unlearned model (i.e., a model trained from scratch on the non-unlearned data), we can quickly
            fine-tune an existing model on these predictions and match the target model predictions out-of-sample.
            Meanwhile, predicting such “oracle” outputs is precisely the goal of a recent line of work in data attribution
            called datamodeling. Combining these two insights yields an end-to-end unlearning algorithm in which one
            first predicts the output of a model re-trained from scratch, then fine-tunes an existing model to match these
            predicted outputs. Across different types and sizes of forget sets on standard classification tasks, we show
            that this two-stage algorithm results in strong unlearning performance being close to indistinguishable
            from the fully-retrained “oracle” model in some cases. As an added benefit, our reduction means that future
            improvements to data attribution—whether in accuracy or efficiency—may in turn yield better unlearning
            algorithms

            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Initially motivated by privacy considerations such as the GDPR's "Right to be Forgotten," machine unlearning seeks to address the challenge of removing the influence of (or "forgetting") selected datapoints from an existing model.

            <h2>2. Unlearning through Data Attribution</h2>
            <p>
                We seek to side-step the problems that arise in the prior heuristic-based machine unlearning methods, by investigating what an optimal unlearner would do given access to predictions of a model retrained from scratch on the retain set.

            <h2>3. Conclusion and discussion</h2>
            <p>
                We show that leveraging data attribution methods offers a fruitful direction for machine unlearning. By leveraging estimates of predictions of the (counterfactual) retrained model, we can sidestep the issue of unknown stopping conditions of prior gradient-based approaches.
